Part I
Decision Making and Reasoning
1. The ”Economic Man vs. Bounded Rationality” Question
Question
Analyze why the ”Model of Economic Man and Woman” is considered an unrealistic description of
human decision-making. Compare this model to the concept ofBounded Rationality. How does
the ”satisficing” strategy (vs. maximizing) demonstrate a more psychologically realistic approach to
choice? Give a real-world example.
Answer
The”Model of Economic Man and Woman”is unrealistic because it assumes humans are perfectly
rational computers. It demands that we arefully informed(know all options),infinitely sensitive
(detect tiny differences), andfully rational(always act to maximize value).
This fails to describe real humans, who operate under limitations. This is whereBounded Rationality
comes in. It’s the more realistic theory that we are rationalwithin limits. Our decision-making is
”bounded” or constrained by our limited cognitive resources, time, and information.
Satisficingis thestrategywe usebecauseof Bounded Rationality.
• An ”Economic Man” would be aMaximizer, needing to examine every single option to find
theabsolute bestone.
• A ”Satisficer” simply considers options one by one until they find one that is”good enough”—
one that meets their minimum level of acceptability.
Example:When choosing a university, aMaximizer(Economic Man) would need to research every
single university in the country and calculate the single highest ”utility” score. This is impossible. A
Satisficer(Bounded Rationality) will search until they find one that meets their criteria (e.g., ”It’s in
Karachi, it has a good Psychology program, and my friends are going there”). They then apply and
stop searching, even if a ”perfect” school might still exist.
2. The ”Strategies of Choice” Question
Question
Imagine a student is choosing which university to attend from a list of 20 options. Apply theSat-
isficingheuristic to this decision (what would they do?). Then, apply theElimination by Aspects
heuristic to thesamedecision. Explain which strategy is more cognitively demanding.
Answer
•Applying Satisficing:The student would look at the universities one by one (e.g., in alphabet-
ical order). They have a ”good enough” mental threshold. They might look at MAJU first. If
it meets their minimum criteria (e.g., ”has my major,” ”is affordable,” ”has a good reputation”),
2

they would stop the search and choose it,even though they haven’t even looked at the other 19
options.
•Applying Elimination by Aspects (EBA):The student wouldnotlook at them one by one.
Instead, they would:
1. Choose the most importantaspect(e.g., ”Must have a Psychology B.S. program”). They
eliminate all 8 universities that don’t.
2. Choose the next aspect (e.g., ”Tuition must be under Rs. 200,000 per semester”). From
the remaining 12, they eliminate 5 more.
3. Choose the next aspect (e.g., ”Must be in Karachi”). From the remaining 7, they eliminate
4 more.
4. They continue this process until only one or two options remain.
Comparison: Elimination by Aspects is more cognitively demanding.Satisficing only requires
you to evaluate one single option at a time against a simple threshold. EBA requires you to define
multiple aspects, rank them by importance, and systematically apply them to theentire setof options,
which is a much more complex analytical process.
3. The ”Heuristic Comparison” Question (Classic)
Question
Compare and contrast theRepresentativeness Heuristicand theAvailability Heuristic. For each:
(1) Define it, (2) Explain the specific error it causes, and (3) Provide a real-world example.
Answer
While both are mental shortcuts, they work in different ways: Representativeness is a bias ofsimilar-
ity, while Availability is a bias ofmemory.
Representativeness Heuristic
1.Definition:We judge the probability of an event by how well itmatches(orrepresents) our
existingprototypeor stereotype.
2.Error:This causes us toignore base rates—the actual statistical frequency of an event in the
population.
3.Example:If I describe a man as ”shy and likes to read,” and ask if he is more likely afarmer
or alibrarian, most people say librarian. Why? His descriptionrepresentsourstereotypeof
a librarian. We ignore thebase rate: there are thousands of times more farmers than male
librarians.
Availability Heuristic
1.Definition:We judge the probability of an event by howeasilyexamples of it come tomind
(how ”available” they are in our memory).
2.Error:This causes us tooverestimatethe frequency of events that are recent, vivid, or heavily
publicized.
3

3.Example:People overestimate the risk of plane crashes. Why? Because every crash is a vivid,
highly publicized news story. It’shighly availablein memory. We underestimate the risk of car
crashes,even though they are statistically far more deadly.
4. The ”Framing & Anchoring Application” Question
Question
You are trying to sell a used car. Explain how you could use theAnchoringbias to get a higher price.
Then, explain how you could use theFraming Effect(specifically ”risk aversion for gains”) to make
a buyer feel good about the deal.
Answer
•Using Anchoring:I would set a very high initial asking price. Let’s say I want to sell the
car for $8,000. I would advertise it for $10,000. This $10,000 becomes the”anchor”(the
initial reference point). All negotiation will now be biased by this high number. When a buyer
negotiates me down to $8,500, theyfeellike they got a great deal, and I getmorethan my target
price.
•Using Framing:I would frame the car’s quality in terms of acertain gain, not a probability.
–Bad Frame (Risky):”This car has a 90% chance of not needing any repairs for a year.”
This introduces a 10% risk, and people arerisk-aversefor gains.
–Good Frame (Certain Gain):”This car isguaranteedto be reliable. I’ll even include a
3-month warranty.” We choose options with ”small but certain gains.” The word”guar-
anteed”is a positive, certain frame that avoids any sense of risk.
5. The ”Bias in Real Life” Question
Question
A student does very poorly on an exam. Analyze this situation using the concepts ofOverconfidence
(before the exam) andHindsight Bias(after getting the grade). What would the student likely say in
each case?
Answer
•Before the Exam (Overconfidence):The student experiencesOverconfidence, an over-valuation
of their own knowledge. As the slide notes, ”people do not realize how little they know.”
– What they say:”I’ve got this, this topic is easy. I glanced at the slides. I’m sure I’ll get
an A.”
•After Getting the Grade (Hindsight Bias):The student, having received a ’D’, now expe-
riencesHindsight Bias, the ”I-knew-it-all-along” effect. They retrospectively believe the bad
outcome was obvious.
– What they say:”I knew it! I knew I was going to fail. The professor’s questions were so
unfair, Iknewshe would ask about that one topic. I totally saw this coming.”
4

This combination is toxic for learning: Overconfidence stops them from preparing, and Hindsight Bias
”hinders learning” by impairing their ability to compare their (wrong) expectation with the outcome.
6. The ”Gambling and Investing” Question
Question
A man has invested $50,000 into a business that is clearly failing.
1. Analyze his decision tokeepinvesting more money using theSunk-Cost Fallacy.
2. Now, imagine he says: ”I know the last 4 investments have failed, so this next one isboundto
be a success!” Identify this error.
3. Explain why his friend (who is ”a bank teller and active in social causes”) islesslikely to be ”a
bank tellerandactive in social causes” thanjust”a bank teller.” What fallacy is this?
Answer
1.Sunk-Cost Fallacy:The $50,000 is the”sunk cost”—it is gone. A rational decision would be
to evaluate the businesstoday. However, the fallacy is that his decision tocontinueinvesting is
driven by hispastinvestment, ”hoping to recover what has already been lost.”
2.Gambler’s Fallacy:This is theGambler’s Fallacy. He mistakenly believes that a series of
past random events (the 4 failures) will influence the probability of the next event. He thinks a
”win” is ”due” to balance things out.
3.Conjunction Fallacy:This is theConjunction Fallacy. It is a basic rule of probability that a
subset (A+B) canneverbe more probable than the larger set (A). The group of ”bank tellers”
includesallbank tellers. The group of ”bank tellersandactive in social causes” is asmaller
subsetof that first group. Therefore, it isalwaysmore probable that she is just a bank teller.
7. The ”Groupthink” Question (A Bestseller)
Question
Imagine you are on a student council that is making a very fast, premature decision to ban an event,
even though some members privately disagree. Identify this asGroupthink. From your slides,
describe threesymptomsyou would look for.
Answer
This phenomenon isGroupthink, defined as ”premature decision making resulting from the group
attempting to avoid conflict.” This is common in ”cohesive, homogenous groups” under ”high stress”.
Based on Slide 28, three symptoms I would look for are:
1.Squelching of Dissent:If one memberdoesraise a concern, other members will quickly shut
them down, saying, ”Come on, we’re all on the same page.”
2.Formation of a ”Mindguard”:One person, often close to the leader, will take on the role
of the”mindguard.”They will actively ”keep the group norm” by filtering information or by
personally telling dissenters to ”get with the program.”
5

3.Feeling Invulnerable and Feeling Unanimous:The group leader might say, ”So, we’re all in
agreement then? Great,” withoutactuallypolling everyone. Thisillusion of unanimity(where
silence is mistaken for agreement) and afeeling of invulnerability(”This is the right choice”)
are classic symptoms.
8. The ”Deductive vs. Inductive” Question
Question
ContrastDeductive ReasoningandInductive Reasoning. Your answermustexplain the key differ-
ence in thecertaintyof their conclusions. Provide your own example of asyllogism(Deductive) and
acausal inference(Inductive).
Answer
The primary difference iscertainty.
•Deductive Reasoningis reasoning from general premises to a specific conclusion. If the
premises are true, the conclusion islogically certainand cannot be false.
•Inductive Reasoningis reasoning from specific facts or observations to a general, probable
conclusion. The conclusion isnever logically certain; it is onlylikelyorprobable.
Deductive Example (Syllogism):
•Major Premise:All courses taught by Miss Somal Kayani are Psychology courses.
•Minor Premise:”Decision Making” is taught by Miss Somal Kayani.
•Conclusion:Therefore, ”Decision Making” is a Psychology course.
• (If the premises are true, this conclusion is 100%certain.)
Inductive Example (Causal Inference):
•Observation:Every time I study for an examafter midnight(Event A), I seem to get a bad
grade (Event B).
•Inference (Conclusion):Therefore, studying after midnightcausesme to get bad grades.
• (This is onlyprobable. It is notcertain. Other factors like stress or ”illusory correlation” could
be the real cause.)
9. The ”Wason Task & Confirmation Bias” Question (Advanced)
Question
Explain what theWason Selection Task(the card task) demonstrates about human reasoning. Con-
nect this toConfirmation Biasby explaininghowthis bias causes people to fail the task. Finally,
explain why people arebetterat this task when it’s presented as aPragmatic Reasoning Schema.
Answer
TheWason Selection Taskdemonstrates that humans arenotnaturally good at abstract, formal de-
ductive logic. Given a rule like ”If a card has a ’D’ (p), it must have a ’3’ (q),” people fail to test it
6

logically.
The failure is caused byConfirmation Bias. This is our tendency to ”seek... information in a way
that confirms” our beliefs.
• People correctly turn over the ’D’ card (toconfirmthere is a ’3’).
• But then theyincorrectlyturn over the ’3’ card (also toconfirm).
• Theyfailto turn over the ’7’ card (not-q). This is the only card that couldfalsifythe rule. We
are biased toconfirma rule, not to try andbreakit.
We arebetterat this task when it uses aPragmatic Reasoning Schemabecause our brains have
evolved to understand real-world rules.
• If the rule is aPermission Schemalike, ”If you are drinking alcohol (p), you must be over 18
(q),” we knowexactlywhat to do.
• We check the person ”drinking alcohol” (p) and we check the person ”under 18” (not-q). This
”cheater detection” is a practical, social reasoning skill that makes the underlying logic intuitive.
10. The ”Big Picture: Two Brains” Question
Question
Analyze a single, complex decision (e.g., ”choosing a career”) using theDual Process Theory. De-
scribe how the ’Associative System’ (System 1) would approach it, and name two specific heuristics
it might use. Then, describe how the ’Rule-based System’ (System 2) would override it.
Answer
Let’s analyze ”choosing a career”:
1.Associative System (System 1):This is thefast, automatic, intuitive, and bias-pronesystem.
It would rely on ”gut feelings.”
•Heuristic 1: Availability Heuristic:This system would recall vivid examples. ”My
cousin is a graphic designer and she seems so happy. That must be a great career.” The
career is ”available” in memory.
•Heuristic 2: Representativeness Heuristic:This system would use stereotypes. ”I am
a caring person who is good at science. Theprototypeof a ’caring science person’ is a
doctor. Therefore, I should be a doctor.”
2.Rule-Based System (System 2):This is theslow, analytical, logical, and effortfulsystem. It
would override the ”gut feeling.”
• It wouldconsciouslyresearch thebase ratesof salary for graphic designers, not just rely
on the ”available” example.
• It wouldlogicallyanalyze the pros and cons ofmultiple”caring science” jobs (e.g., re-
searcher, pharmacist), not just the one thatrepresentsthe stereotype.
• It would engage inanalytical thinkinglike, ”To be a doctor, I need to go to medical school,
take on debt, and do a residency...” This is the slow, effortful system at work.

Part II
Visual Perception
1. The ”Tree in the Forest” Question
Question
Your slides pose the classic riddle: ”If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it
make a sound?” Answer this riddle twice: first from the perspective ofSensation, and second from
the perspective ofPerception.
Answer
This is the classic question that separates sensation from perception.
1.From the perspective of Sensation (YES):A ”sound” is aphysical event. The falling tree
(stimulus) displaces air, creating physicalsound wavesthat radiate outward. This is the ”raw
information from the environment.” This physical phenomenon (the sensation) occurs whether
an ear is present to detect it or not.
2.From the perspective of Perception (NO):A ”sound” is apsychological experience. For the
sound waves to become ”sound,” they must be detected by a sense organ (an ear) and, crucially,
be ”given meaning and interpretation” by a brain (perception). As your slide states, perception
is apsychological process. Without a brain to interpret the raw sensory signals, theexperience
of sound does not exist.
2. The ”Attention & the Gorilla” Question
Question
In the ”Invisible Gorilla Experiment”, the participants’sensationclearly registered the gorilla (light
waves hit their retinas).Analyzewhythey failed toperceivethe gorilla. What does this experiment
demonstrate about the relationship betweenattention,sensation, andperception?
Answer
This experiment is the perfect demonstration thatsensation can occurwithoutperception.
•Sensation Occurred:The light waves from the gorilla’s imagedidenter the participants’ eyes,
hit their retinas, and were successfully transduced into electrochemical impulses. Theraw data
was successfully detected.
•Perception Failed:Perception, unlike sensation, is not automatic. It is an active process
that requiresattention. The participants were engaged in a demanding task (counting bas-
ketball passes) that consumed their attentional resources. Because their attention was directed
elsewhere, the sensory information from the gorilla—though present—was never selected for
higher-level processing.
8

•Relationship:This experiment proves thatattention acts as a filter or gatekeeperthat de-
termines which sensations get to become conscious perceptions. We are ”blind” to things we
don’t pay attention to, even if they are right in front of our eyes.
3. The ”Two Theories” Question (Classic)
Question
Compare and contrastBottom-Up processing and Top-Down processing. Your answer must: (1)
Define each, (2) Provide one specific theory as an example for each, and (3) Explain why ”degraded
stimuli” force the brain to relymoreon Top-Down processing.
Answer
1.Definitions:
•Bottom-Up Processingis ”data-driven.” Perception begins with the raw sensory input.
The brain builds up a perception by starting with the smallest features and assembling
them into a meaningful whole.
•Top-Down Processingis ”knowledge-driven.” Our existing knowledge, expectations, and
contextguidehow we interpret sensory input. We start with a high-level concept (the
”top”) and use it to make sense of the data (the ”bottom”).
2.Examples from your Slides:
•Bottom-Up Example:Recognition-by-Components (RBC) Theory. It states that we first
detect basic edges, which we then use to identify ”geons” (3D building blocks). We then
combine these geons to recognize the object.
•Top-Down Example:Context Effects. We recognize a ”loaf of bread”fasterin a kitchen
scene than in a random scene. Our high-levelknowledgeof ”kitchens” (the top-down
context)primesour brain to expect kitchen-related objects.
3.Degraded Stimuli:When a stimulus is ”unclear, weak, or incomplete” (like the ”ST P” sign),
thebottom-up data is insufficient. The raw features are ”degraded” and ambiguous. The
braincannotbuild a reliable perception from the bottom-up alone. Therefore, itmustrely on
Top-Down processingto fill in the gaps. Our brain makes an educated guess based on context
(”this is an intersection”) to construct a complete perception.
4. The ”Evolution of Theories” Question
Question
AnalyzetheweaknessofTemplate Theorythat led to its rejection.ExplainhowFeature-Matching
Theorywas an improvement. Finally,explainthe main advantageRecognition-by-Components
(RBC) Theoryhas overboth.
Answer
•Weakness of Template Theory:Its weakness is its extremeinflexibility. It requires a 1-to-1
match between the sensory input and a stored ”template.” This fails in the real world. We would
9

need an impossibly large library of templates for every object in every possible orientation, size,
and font.
•Improvement of Feature-Matching Theory:This was a major improvement because itis
flexible. Instead of matching thewholeobject, it just breaks the object down into its core
features(e.g., lines, curves). ThePandemonium Modelis a great example. This is better
because all letter ’A’s (A,A,A) share the same features.
•Advantage of RBC Theory:RBC’s main advantage isviewpoint invariance. Feature-matching
still struggles when an object is rotated in 3D, as its 2D features change. RBC solves this by
proposinggeons, which are 3D building blocks. The geons of an object (like the cylinder and
handle of amug) are recognizable from almostanyangle.
5. The ”What vs. Where” Question (A Bestseller)
Question
Contrastthe”What” (Ventral) Pathwayand the”Where/How” (Dorsal) Pathway. Now, use this
to analyze two patients:
• Patient A hasVisual-Object Agnosia. Which pathway is likely damaged?Justify.
• Patient B hasOptic Ataxia. Which pathway is likely damaged?Justify.
Answer
These are the two crucial streams of visual processing:
• The”What” (Ventral) Pathwayflows to thetemporal lobeand is responsible forobject
identification(its shape, color, and identity).
• The”Where/How” (Dorsal) Pathwayflows to theparietal lobeand is responsible for pro-
cessing the object’slocationin space andhow to interactwith it.
Patient Analysis:
•Patient A (Visual-Object Agnosia):This patient has damage to the”What” (Ventral) Path-
way.
–Justification:They canseethe object’s parts (their ”Where” stream is fine) but cannot
identifywhat it is. Their identity-processing stream is broken, so they can’t link the fea-
tures to a stored concept like ”eyeglasses.”
•Patient B (Optic Ataxia):This patient has damage to the”Where/How” (Dorsal) Pathway.
–Justification:Their ”What” stream is intact, so they canidentifythe object perfectly (”That
is a broom”). However, their ”How” stream is broken, leading to an ”impairment in using
visual information to guide physical movement.” They cannot guide their hand to accu-
rately grasp the object they clearly see.
10

6. The ”Face & Expert” Question (Advanced)
Question
A patient with damage to theFusiform GyrusdevelopsProsopagnosia(face blindness).Explain
how theExpert-Individuation Hypothesisrefinesthis diagnosis. According to this hypothesis, what
other(non-face) recognition skill would this patient likely lose,assuming they were an expertin it?
Answer
•Analysis:Initially, damage to theFusiform Gyruswas linked only toProsopagnosia, leading
scientists to believe this was a ”face-only” brain module.
•Refinement:TheExpert-Individuation Hypothesisrefinesthis idea. It proposes that the
Fusiform Gyrus isnotjust for faces, but foranyvisual category in which we areexpertsand
must make ”fine-tuned individual distinctions.” Faces are simply theonecategory we areall
experts at.
•Application:According to this hypothesis, if this patient with Prosopagnosia wasalsoa car
expert or a bird-watching expert, they wouldalsolose this specific expert skill. They would
still be able to recognize ”a car,” but they would lose their expert ability toindividuateit, for
example, ”That is a 1968 Ford Mustang, not a 1969.”
7. The ”Gestalt” Question (Application)
Question
You are looking at a poster for a concert.Explainhow theGestalt Principleshelp you organize the
visual information.Applythe principles of: (1) Figure-Ground, (2) Proximity, and (3) Closure.
Answer
The Gestalt principles are how our brain automatically organizes sensory parts into a meaningful
whole.
1.Figure-Ground:The first thing my brain does is a ”figure–ground relationship.” The poster
itself, with its text and images, becomes thefigure—the clear, unified object of my attention.
The wall it is hanging on becomes the diffuse, unattendedground.
2.Proximity:The poster has words on it. I don’t see a jumble of 200 individual letters. My
brain uses theprinciple of proximityto automatically group letters that areclose togetherinto
words, and words that areclose togetherinto sentences.
3.Closure:The band’s logo might be stylized, using an ”incomplete” font where the letters have
gaps in them. My brain uses theprinciple of closureto automaticallyfill in the gapsand
perceivecompleteletters, allowing me to read the logo effortlessly.
11

8. The ”Constancy” Question (Application)
Question
A door is opening toward you. The image on your retina is changing from a rectangle to a trapezoid.
Analyzethis situation usingShape Constancy. Then, as a person walks away,analyzewhy you
perceive them as ”getting farther away” rather than ”shrinking,” usingSize Constancy.
Answer
•Shape Constancy:As the door opens, the raw sensory image on myretinachanges. This is
thesensation. However, myperceptiondoes not change. My brain, using top-down knowl-
edge about doors, appliesshape constancy. It ”knows” the door’sactualshape is a rectangle.
Therefore, Iperceivean unchanging, rectangular doormoving—not a shape that ismorphing
from a rectangle to a trapezoid.
•Size Constancy:As the person walks away, the image they project on myretinagets objec-
tivelysmaller. Again, I do not perceive the person as physicallyshrinking. My brain uses other
depth cues to understand they are movingaway. It then appliessize constancy, automatically
scaling the retinal image up so that myperceptionis of a person of stable, constant size who is
simplyincreasing their distance.

Part III
Cognitive Neuroscience Methods
1. The ”Central Trade-off” Question
Question
Your slides emphasize a central ”trade-off.”Explainthe difference betweenTemporal Resolution
andSpatial Resolution.Compare EEGandfMRIusing this trade-off. Why can’t a researcher get
”the best of both worlds” (high temporal and high spatial) from a single method like fMRI?
Answer
This is the core concept of neuroscience methods.
•Temporal Resolutionis abouttime. It’s howquicklythe method can detect changes in brain
activity (e.g., in milliseconds).
•Spatial Resolutionis aboutlocation. It’s howaccuratelythe method can pinpoint the source
of the activity (e.g., in millimeters).
Comparison:
•EEGhasexcellent temporal resolution(˜1 ms). It measures electrical ”brain waves” directly
from the scalp in real-time. But it haspoor spatial resolution(˜1-2 cm) because the electrical
signal gets smeared by the skull, so we can’t tell exactlywhereit came from.
•fMRIhasgood spatial resolution(˜1-3 mm). It can pinpoint activity in deep brain structures.
But it haspoor temporal resolution(˜1-2 seconds).
Why not both?An fMRIcannotbe fast because it does not measure neural firing directly. It measures
theblood flow(the BOLD signal) thatfollowsneural firing. This blood flow response is extremely
slow and sluggish, taking several seconds to rise and fall. The machine is tracking a slow biological
process, not the instantaneous firing of a neuron.
2. The ”Causality” Question (Classic)
Question
Most human brain imaging (like fMRI and EEG) iscorrelational.Analyzewhat this means. Now,
contrastthis withTMS(Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation). Why is TMS considered a unique and
powerful tool thatcanestablishcausalrelationships?
Answer
•Correlational:When a person does Task A (e.g., look at a face) and Brain Area B (e.g.,
the fusiform gyrus) ”lights up” in an fMRI, we have only found acorrelation. We know the
two events happen together. We donotknow if Area Bcausedthe face recognition, if the
recognitioncausedArea B to light up, or if a third variable (like ”attention”) caused both. We
see arelationship, not acause.
13

•Causal (TMS): TMSis unique because it allows forintervention. It sends a magnetic pulse
to a specific, superficial brain region totemporarily disrupt or ”deactivate” it.
–If we use TMS to disrupt Area B, and the person suddenlycannotperform Task A (e.g.,
they can’t recognize the face), we have established acausal link.
–We have shown that the normal functioning of Area B iscausally necessaryfor performing
Task A. This is a much more powerful finding than a simple correlation.
3. The ”Gold Standard” Question
Question
According to your slides,Single-Cell Recordinghasbothexcellent temporal and excellent spatial
resolution. If it’s the ”best” in precision,analyzewhy it isnotthe primary method used in human
cognitive neuroscience. What are its major limitations?
Answer
Single-Cell Recordingis the ”gold standard” for precision (˜1 ms temporal, ˜0.1 mm spatial), but it
ishighly invasive.
•Limitation:It requires surgically implanting a micro-electrode deep into the brain tissue to
record the electrical firing of asingle neuron.
•Application:This is not ethically or safely possible in healthy human subjects. Therefore, its
use is ”typically limited toanimal studies” (like rats or monkeys) or, in very rare human cases,
on patients who are already undergoing brain surgery for a medical reason (like epilepsy).
• We use non-invasive methods like fMRI and EEG in healthy humans, sacrificing the ”best”
precision forhuman suitability and safety.
4. The ”Middle Ground” Question
Question
A researcher wants to study language processing, which is very fast (milliseconds) but also located
in specific cortical areas.AnalyzewhyfMRI(too slow) andEEG(too imprecise) are both non-ideal
for this.ExplainhowMEGacts as a ”bridge” to help solve this problem.
Answer
•fMRI is non-ideal:Language processing (e.g., understanding a word) happens in hundreds of
milliseconds. An fMRI’s temporal resolution is inseconds(˜1-2 s). It is far too slow and would
miss the entire event, averaging it all together.
•EEG is non-ideal:EEG is fast enough (˜1 ms temporal resolution). However, its spatial reso-
lution ispoor(˜1-2 cm). It could tellwhena language event happened, but it couldn’t reliably
tellwhichspecific language area (e.g., Broca’s area vs. Wernicke’s area) was responsible.
•MEG as a ”Bridge”: MEG(Magnetoencephalography) is the ”bridge” because it has the
excellent temporal resolutionof EEG (˜1 ms) butmoderate spatial resolution(˜5-10 mm),
which is much better than EEG. It detects the magnetic fields produced by neural activity.
14

Because magnetic fields are not distorted by the skull (unlike the electrical fields in EEG),
MEG can provide a much more accurate location for the fast-acting language processes.
5. The ”Multimodal Solution” Question
Question
Your final slide mentions ”multimodal imaging.”Explainthis concept.Proposea multimodal study
(e.g., combining two methods) to study anxiety.Justifyyour choice by explaining how thestrengths
of one method would compensate for thelimitationsof the other.
Answer
Multimodal Imagingmeans using two or more neurophysiological methods at the same time (or
in the same study) to get a more complete picture of brain function. The goal is to combine their
strengths to overcome their individual limitations.
Proposed Study: Combining EEG and fMRI to study anxiety.
•Procedure:Place an EEG cap (which is fMRI-safe) on a participant’s head and have them
lie inside an fMRI scanner. Show them a series of images, some neutral (a chair) and some
anxiety-provoking (a snake).
•Justification (How they compensate):
1. TheEEG(strength: excellent temporal resolution) will capture theexact millisecondthe
brain’s ”fear circuit” (like the amygdala) fires after seeing the snake. This compensates
for the fMRI’slimitation(poor temporal resolution).
2. ThefMRI(strength: good spatial resolution) will pinpointwhichdeep brain structures
(like the amygdala, the prefrontal cortex, the insula) are lighting up. This compensates for
the EEG’slimitation(poor spatial resolution).
•Result:By combining them, we can seeboththe precisetiming(from EEG)andthe precise
location(from fMRI) of the anxiety response, something neither method could provide alone.

Part IV
Introduction to Cognitive Psychology
1. Activity 1 (from slide): The ”Cocktail Party Effect”
Question
”Step outside, observe any cognitive activity, and analyze what mental processes are involved and
how they work.” (Using the ”Cocktail Party Effect” as an example).
Answer
•Observation:I am at a loud, crowded cafeteria at MAJU. I am focused on a conversation with
my friend, but my attention snaps to another table when someone says my name, ”Alina.”
•Analysis of Mental Processes:
– Sensation:My ears are taking inallthe sound waves from the room at once—a single,
messy, overwhelming wave of sound.
– Selective Attention:My brain is activelyselectingthe sound pattern of my friend’s voice
andsuppressing(or ”turning down the volume on”) all the other irrelevant sounds.
– Unconscious Monitoring:Here is the key part. A part of my brain isunconsciously
monitoringall the ”suppressed” sounds in the background. It is filtering this background
noise for one specific, highly important pattern: my own name.
– Attentional Shift:The moment someone at another table speaks my name, my uncon-
scious monitor sends an ”alert.” Myselective attentionautomaticallybreaks away from
my friend’s conversation and shifts to the source of my name.
– Memory (Recognition):This entire process is only possible because the sound ”Alina”
is stored in mylong-term memoryas a high-priority signal.
2. Activity 2 (from slide): Connecting to Historical Approaches
Question
”Using the data you collected [the Cocktail Party Effect], reflect on which historical approach better
explains your chosen cognitive activity and why?”
Answer
•Behaviorism (The ”Black Box”):This school failscompletely. A behaviorist could only
observe thestimulus(my name being spoken) and theresponse(my head turning). They
would haveno wayto explain the internal, unobservable mental processes ofselective attention
orunconscious monitoring. The entire phenomenon happens inside the ”black box.”
•Functionalism (William James):This is amuch betterfit. A functionalist would ask, ”What
is thepurposeorfunctionof this effect?” The clear answer issurvival and social relevance. It
16

is highly adaptive (functional) to be able to monitor our environment for important social cues
(like our name) even when we are busy. This approach explainswhythe effect exists.
•Modern Cognitive Psychology:This is thebestapproach. It’s the only one that provides the
tools to create a testablemodelof how this works. A cognitive psychologist would useem-
piricalexperiments (like dichotic listening tasks) to build arationalisttheory (an information-
processing model) of attention, complete with filters and a ”dictionary” for important words
like our name.
3. The ”Rationalism vs. Empiricism” Question
Question
Contrast Rationalism(Descartes) andEmpiricism(Locke).Analyzewhy a modern cognitive psy-
chologist cannotonlybe one or the other, and explain how the two philosophies aresynthesizedin
modern research.
Answer
•Rationalism (Descartes):This is the belief that knowledge comes fromlogical analysis and
internal reflection. It is a ”top-down” approach thatemphasizes theory construction.
•Empiricism (Locke):This is the belief that knowledge comes fromobservation and expe-
rience. The mind starts as a ”tabula rasa” (blank slate). It is a ”bottom-up” approach that
emphasizes data gathering.
Synthesis:A modern cognitive psychologistmustbe both.
1. Research starts withEmpiricism(data gathering): A psychologistobservesa phenomenon
(e.g., George Millerobservesthat people can only remember about 7 items).
2. This data is then used to build a *theory* (Rationalism): Millertheorizesthat this is due to a
”limit in information processing.”
3. Thistheorythen guides new research (Empiricism): ”If this theory is true,thenwe should
observethat ’chunking’ information will help people remember more.”
As your slide says,data informs theory, and theory guides data interpretation.They work in a
continuous cycle.
4. The ”Chomsky vs. Behaviorism” Question (A Bestseller)
Question
Analyzewhy theBehavioristview of the mind as a ”black box” (focusing only on S-R) was a
major problem for psychology. UsingNoam Chomsky’scritique of language, explain how language
acquisitioncannotbe explained by simple reinforcement.
Answer
The Behaviorist ”black box” view was a problem because itintentionally ignoredall the most inter-
esting parts of being human: thought, memory, and perception.
17

Noam Chomsky’s critique of language was a key part of the Cognitive Revolution because it showed
that behaviorismcould notexplain a complex, universal human skill:
• Behaviorism (like B.F. Skinner’s) argued that children learn language through simplestimulus-
response (S-R) and reinforcement. (e.g., Child says ”milk,” Mother gives milk (reinforce-
ment)).
•Chomsky’s Critique:
1.Creative Language:Children say things they havenever heard beforeand havenever
been reinforced for(e.g., ”Igoedto the store”). This creative generation of language is
impossible in a simple S-R model.
2.Poverty of the Stimulus:The language children hear (the stimulus) is often messy and
ungrammatical. Yet, theyallmanage to extract the complexrulesof grammar (the syntax)
from it.
•Conclusion:Chomsky argued that language must be based oninnate, biological structures
in the brain—a ”language acquisition device.” This idea—that we must look at internal mental
structures—was a direct attack on the ”black box.”
5. The ”Miller & Hebb” Question (Key Figures)
Question
Your slides mention two key figures:George MillerandDonald Hebb.Explainthe ”magic number
seven” and what it revealed about information processing. Then,explainHebbian Learning and its
importance.
Answer
•George Miller (1956):His ”magic number seven, plus or minus two” was a landmark in
cognitive psychology.
– What it is:Miller observed that for many different tasks (like remembering lists of num-
bers), people’sshort-term memory capacityconsistently ”broke” at around 7 items.
– What it revealed:This was the first strong evidence that our internal mental processes
have afixed, measurable limitor ”bottleneck.” This supported the new idea of the brain
as a type of information processor, which is a core concept of cognitive psychology.
•Donald Hebb (1949):Hebb provided thebiological linkfor the cognitive revolution.
– What it is:Hebbian Learning, or ”Hebb’s Rule,” is the simple idea that”neurons that
fire together, wire together.”
– What it revealed:When one neuron helps to fire another, the connection (synapse) be-
tween them gets stronger. This was the first plausible theory to connect thepsychological
act oflearning(Associationism) to theneurologicalact ofneurons connecting, bridging
the gap between psychology and neuroscience.

6. The ”Interdisciplinary” Question
Question
Cognitive psychology is a ”unified field” that draws on many other disciplines.Analyzehow studying
AI(like the Turing Test) orAnthropology(culture and brain wiring) helps a psychologist understand
human cognition.
Answer
Cognitive psychology cannot exist in a vacuum. It needs these other fields to get a complete picture:
•How AI Helps (Computer Science):
1.AI helps Psychology:To understand the human mind, we can try tobuild a modelof it. If
we can design a computer program (an AI) thatsimulatesa human cognitive process (like
language), it proves we have a goodtheoryof how that process works. TheTuring Test
is a test of this: if an AI can simulate human conversation, what does that tell us about our
own ”thinking”?
2.Psychology helps AI:To build abetterAI, computer scientists study thehuman brain—
the best ”computer” that exists—to get new ideas.
•How Anthropology Helps:If weonlystudy psychology students at MAJU, we might mis-
takenly think a cognitive process is ”universal.”Anthropologyteaches us thatculture can
literally ”rewire” the brain.
–For example, some cultures’ languages may not have words for ”left” and ”right,” using
only ”north” and ”south” (cardinal directions). This cultural difference forces their brains
to develop acompletely differentand superior system for spatial awareness. This shows
us that our cognitive processes are not just fixed biology but are alsoflexibleand shaped
by our cultural environment. itemize
