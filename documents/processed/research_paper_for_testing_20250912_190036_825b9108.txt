This study explores the application of machine learning algorithms in predicting high-risk pregnancy 
among expectant mothers, aiming to construct an efficient predictive model to improve maternal 
health management. The study is based on the maternal health risk dataset (MHRD) from Bangladesh, 
covering multiple hospitals, community clinics, and maternal healthcare centers, and encompassing 
health data from 1014 pregnant women. Six machine learning algorithms—multilayer perceptron 
(MLP), logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting 
(XGBoost), and support vector machine (SVM)—are employed to construct predictive models. It is 
worth noting that MLP demonstrates superior performance compared with the other five algorithms. 
By applying the MLP method, the study successfully established an efficient pregnancy risk prediction 
model. The model evaluation results indicate that it has high accuracy in predicting pregnancy risks, 
with an overall accuracy rate of 82%, and particularly high accuracy in high-risk predictions, reaching 
91%. With the computational support of an NVIDIA GPU RTX3050Ti, the model demonstrated 
excellent data processing capabilities, capable of predicting and processing 500 sets of data items per 
second. This study not only showcases the enormous potential of machine learning technology in the 
healthcare field, especially in the rapid and accurate identification of high-risk pregnancies, providing a 
powerful decision-support tool for medical professionals, but also offers significant reference value for 
future research in this area.

During pregnancy, certain complications or pathogenic factors may threaten the life safety of the pregnant 
woman, fetus, and newborn, which are defined as high-risk pregnancies 1. In recent years, researchers such as 
Mavreli et al.2 have emphasized that early identification of high-risk pregnancies can effectively reduce the risk 
of perinatal mortality, pregnancy-related complications, and neonatal complications. However, due to a lack of 
professional knowledge and assessment skills, junior nursing staff may have deficiencies in clinical decision-
making capabilities, which could affect the accuracy of pregnancy risk stratification 3. It is noteworthy that 
significant progress has been made in the field of obstetrics and gynecology using machine learning technology. 
Researchers like Kovacheva4 have predicted early and late pregnancy risks from clinical and genetic perspectives 
through machine learning and polygenic risk scores. Chu et al. 5 used machine learning methods to predict the 
risk of adverse events in pregnant women with congenital heart disease. These advances indicate that, with the 
development of smart medicine, machine learning technology has shown great advantages in the field of disease 
prediction and diagnosis6,7.

It is crucial to identify high-risk vulnerable populations as early as possible during pregnancy8,9. Developing 
innovative predictive methods is essential for identifying high-risk pregnant women10,11. This study introduces 
an innovative predictive model based on the MLP machine learning algorithm for identifying high-risk 
pregnancies. Compared with five other machine learning algorithms, it demonstrates superior performance, 
filling a gap in the existing research on MLP-based predictive models for high-risk pregnancies.
The model’s performance is evaluated by assessing its accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC in 
predicting high-, medium-, and low-risk pregnancies. This approach enables healthcare providers to detect 
high-risk pregnancies using basic clinical parameters, including age, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, blood 
glucose levels, body temperature, and heart rate. This facilitates the implementation of preventive measures. 
After prediction, pregnant women can receive targeted care based on their predicted risk levels, ensuring a 
smooth pregnancy and reducing the occurrence of complications12. Therefore, this study aims to explore the use 
of machine learning models for high-risk pregnancy risk prediction and evaluation, hoping to provide valuable 
reference for healthcare professionals in assessing and treating high-risk pregnant women.
Methods
2.1 Research process
This study harnessed the open-source MHRD from Bangladeshi medical institutions, covering multiple 
hospitals, community clinics, and maternal healthcare centers, and encompassing data on 1014 pregnant 
women. Records of pregnant women aged 10–18 years were excluded due to ethical concerns and data sparsity, 
ensuring the dataset’s clinical validity. Risk levels are stratified into low, medium, and high categories. Post-data 
preprocessing, the dataset is randomly divided into a training set of 362 and a test set of 90, adhering to an 
8:2 ratio. To curb overfitting in the MLP model, early stopping is employed 13. The model’s predictive accuracy 
is gauged through a confusion matrix and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, with the research 
flowchart delineated in Fig. 1.

Data distribution
The input features include maternal age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose levels, 
body temperature, heart rate, and risk level. These features were selected based on their established medical 
relevance to pregnancy risk assessment. After data cleaning and deduplication, a total of 452 data entries were 
obtained in this study, including 234 low-risk entries, 106 medium-risk entries, and 112 high-risk entries. The 
data distribution is shown in Fig. 2.
In Fig. 3, there are three box plots and one histogram. Figure 3a, b, d are box plots representing the distribution 
of age, blood sugar, and heart rate across different risk levels in the dataset, respectively. Figure 3c is a histogram 
showing the distribution of risk levels corresponding to different heart rates. From Fig.  3a–d, it is evident that 
individuals with a high pregnancy risk level have higher age, blood sugar, and heart rate compared to those with 
medium and low risk levels, which aligns with medical objective principles.

Machine learning methods
Six machine learning algorithms—MLP , LR, DT, RF , XGBoost, and SVM—are employed to construct predictive 
models. It is worth noting that MLP demonstrates superior performance compared with the other five 
algorithms. This choice is based on the comprehensive evaluation of each algorithm’s performance in terms 
of accuracy, precision, and other relevant metrics. In this study, we’ve adopted a multifaceted strategy to refine 
the accuracy and generalization of our MLP model, which includes data preprocessing, the application of the 
SMOTE algorithm to address class imbalance, and the implementation of early stopping to prevent overfitting. 
The MLP model consists of three hidden layers, with 256, 128, and 64 neurons respectively. All hidden layers 
utilize the ReLU activation function and are followed by a SoftMax output layer. To prevent overfitting, Dropout 
layers with a dropout rate of 0.5 are inserted after the first two hidden layers. The model was trained using the 
Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a cross-entropy loss function. The batch size was set to 32, 
and the maximum number of training epochs was 10,000. Training would be halted if the validation loss did not 
improve for 300 epochs.
Our data cleaning process was essential for ensuring data quality, where we removed erroneous, duplicate, 
or irrelevant information from the open-source dataset from Bangladesh, including outliers such as records of 
pregnant women aged between 10 and 18 years. We quantified risk levels numerically, assigning values of 2, 1, 
and 0 to high, medium, and low risks, respectively, to facilitate subsequent analysis. To accurately assess model 
performance, we divided the dataset into a training set, comprising 80% of the data, and a test set, comprising 
20%, using stratified random sampling to maintain the distribution of each category across both sets. To combat 
overfitting and enhance the model’s ability to learn from the minority class, we applied the SMOTE algorithm 
and introduced Dropout layers within the MLP model. We applied SMOTE exclusively to the training set post-
split to avoid data leakage The test set remained unmodified to ensure unbiased evaluation. Additionally, we 
employed early stopping with a patience parameter P , which monitors performance on the test set and halts 
training if there’s no improvement for P consecutive epochs, reverting the model to its best-performing state. 
This approach not only prevents overfitting but also ensures that the model retains its peak performance.
For model interpretability analysis, we utilized a confusion matrix and ROC curve to assess the performance 
of the optimal model. The confusion matrix provides a clear view of the model’s predictive accuracy, while the 
ROC curve offers an intuitive representation of the model’s overall performance by comparing true positive 
and false positive rates across various thresholds. These methods validate the model’s risk level predictions and 
enhance the interpretability of the results, thereby ensuring the reliability of our predictions.
Experimental platform
This study was conducted on a computer equipped with an NVIDIA GPU RTX3050Ti, a CPU model AMD 
Ryzen 7 5800H, and 1.5TB of disk space. All experiments were based on the Python programming language. 
To build and train the MLP model, TensorFlow (2.18.0) and Keras (3.6.0) libraries were used. Data processing 
and analysis benefited from Pandas (2.2.3) and NumPy (1.24.4), while data visualization was performed using 
Matplotlib (3.5.1). Model optimization was achieved using Sklearn (1.5.2).
Results
Table 1 presents a comparison of the performance parameters of the MLP model with five other algorithms. 
Among these five algorithms, the one using LR for high-risk pregnancy prediction achieved the lowest 
performance, with an accuracy of 0.61 and precision of 0.59. In contrast, the RF algorithm demonstrated 
the highest performance for high-risk pregnancy prediction, with an accuracy of 0.78 and precision of 0.79. 
Compared with these five algorithms, the MLP model constructed in this study exhibited superior performance, 
achieving an accuracy of 0.81 and precision of 0.82.
Table 2 illustrates that the MLP model performs well across different risk categories, particularly in the high-
risk category, achieving an accuracy, recall, and F1 score of 0.91. The performance in the medium-risk category 
is slightly lower, with an accuracy and recall of 0.80 and 0.83, respectively, and an F1 score of 0.81. The low-
risk category has slightly lower accuracy, recall, and F1 scores of 0.77, 0.73, and 0.75, respectively. The overall 
accuracy is 0.82, indicating excellent overall performance of the model.
The normalized confusion matrix shows the performance of the MLP model in predicting risk levels in high-
risk pregnancies, covering high, medium, and low risk levels. The model excels in high-risk prediction with 
an accuracy of 91%, with misclassification rates of 2% for low risk and 7% for medium risk. The accuracy for 
low-risk prediction is 83%, with a 14% misclassification rate for medium risk. Medium-risk prediction accuracy 
stands at 73%, with misclassification rates of 24% for low risk and 3% for high risk. Overall, the model is reliable 
in predicting pregnancy risk for pregnant women (Fig. 4).

The ROC curve analysis shows that the MLP model achieves an AUC value of 0.99 for the high-risk category 
when predicting pregnancy risk levels, indicating near-perfect identification. The ROC curve closely aligns with 
the top left corner, demonstrating the ability to achieve a high true positive rate at a very low false positive rate 
(Fig. 5).
Discussion
Accurate prediction and treatment options for pregnancy risk are crucial
This study aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting high-risk pregnancy in expectant mothers. 
By analyzing the health data of pregnant women, the model can accurately assess pregnancy risk levels, 
demonstrating excellent accuracy and efficiency14. This tool can support clinical nurses in making more precise 
risk assessments during evaluations, thereby enabling appropriate interventions to reduce pregnancy risks.
High-risk pregnancy refers to a pregnancy state that faces higher risks due to various high-risk factors 
(such as personal health issues, pregnancy complications, adverse environmental impacts, etc.) 1,2 during the 
pregnancy period. Such pregnancy conditions increase maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality rates. 
Taking China as an example, with the development of society, the implementation of the universal two-child 
policy, and the popularization of assisted reproductive technology, the incidence of high-risk pregnancies is 
increasing year by year. Compared to normal pregnancies, high-risk pregnancies significantly increase the risk 
of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight, neonatal complications, and death. 
Moreover, the diagnosis of high-risk pregnancy may lead to reduced coping ability, decreased well-being, and 
increased psychiatric symptoms in pregnant women, including stress, depression, and anxiety15.
Therefore, accurately and early identifying pregnancy risks and implementing effective management 
measures are crucial for improving maternal and infant health. Nurses, as the first medical team members to 
contact pregnant women and collect their basic information, play a critical role in the early identification and 
management of high-risk pregnancies16. However, since the health status of pregnant women may change over 
time, continuous monitoring by nurses is required, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore,

developing a simple yet accurate tool for identifying high-risk pregnancies is particularly important for ensuring 
the health and safety of mothers and newborns.
Artificial intelligence-assisted diagnosis and treatment of pregnancy risk becomes possible
High-risk pregnancies pose significant health risks to mothers and newborns, involving various complex factors 
such as advanced maternal age, multiple pregnancies, and pregnancy complications, leading to increased rates 
of difficult labor and cesarean sections, as well as an increase in neonatal health issues 17. These situations place 
high professional demands on medical and nursing staff, emphasizing the need for rigorous and professional 
measures. The World Health Organization points out that most deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth can 
be prevented through timely identification and response to pregnancy risks18. Timely intervention in pregnancy 
risks and quality healthcare services are key.
In 2017, China implemented a pregnancy risk assessment and management system, adopting a five-color 
grading system to assess maternal risk levels and adjust medical resource allocation accordingly, effectively 
reducing adverse outcomes of high-risk pregnancies19. However, traditional risk assessment methods have issues 
with large workloads and low efficiency.
The machine learning method based on the MLP proposed in this study demonstrates remarkable 
performance in predicting high-risk pregnancies. Compared with other methods, it achieves an accuracy rate of 
up to 91% in predicting high-risk cases. Moreover, the method is highly efficient, with the capability to process 
up to 500 sets of data per second. This method not only improves the efficiency and accuracy of risk assessment 
but also reduces the workload on medical staff and the demand for medical resources, showing great potential 
in optimizing pregnancy risk management using advanced technology.
Additionally, by utilizing the SMOTE algorithm 20 and early stopping mechanisms 21, our model has 
demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities. It effectively addresses the issue of data imbalance and 
prevents overfitting. This ensures that the model performs well not only on the training data but also maintains 
high accuracy and reliability when applied to unseen data.
This study is innovative not only in its technical approach but also in its practical application. By accurately 
predicting the risks associated with high-risk pregnancies, our model serves as an important decision-support 
tool for clinical practice. It enables healthcare professionals to take preemptive interventions, thereby reducing 
the risk of complications for both mothers and infants12.
Conclusions
This study successfully developed a machine learning based high-risk pregnancy prediction model, which 
estimates pregnancy risk by analyzing the health data of pregnant women, with an accuracy rate of up to 91%, and 
can accurately assess the level of pregnancy risk. At the same time, it also has a fast prediction speed, which not 
only improves the efficiency of pregnancy risk assessment, but also reduces the workload of medical personnel 
and the demand for medical resources, demonstrating the huge potential of using advanced technology to 
optimize pregnancy risk management.
